**Describe the bug**

JVM mode tests are failing to launch due to issues with docker.  From the output, I'm not clear if the parameters are incorrect (`DOCKERIMAGE_TAG`) or the box needs to login to a specific registry?

Output:
```
11:17:02  Unable to recognize DOCKER_OS from DOCKERIMAGE_TAG = --version!
11:17:02  Unable to find image 'adoptopenjdk-derby-test:11-jdk-ubuntu-openj9-full' locally
11:17:03  docker: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for adoptopenjdk-derby-test, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'.
```

**To Reproduce**
Look at the output from one of the recent extended external tests
ie: https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/Test_openjdk11_j9_extended.external_ppc64le_linux_quarkus/

**Expected behavior**
Tests run =)

**Additional context**
All extended external quarkus testing: https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/Test_external_weekly/search/?q=quarkus&Jenkins-Crumb=a641a495ab24a32df0acfed743a5be4ea8142dcf58b19aabc754ef73c5df2257

This is an issue for both OpenJ9 and Hotspot based testing across all platforms.
